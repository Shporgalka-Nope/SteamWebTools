                "description":"This is my cool extra simfphys features addon. It is probably very badly written since I am not a coder and I don't know what I'm doing 90% of the time, so please excuse any performance issues. (Although I did testing and it doesn't seem to affect performance too much.)\r\n\r\n[h1]What you get out the box on ALL simfphys vehicles:[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*][b]Advanced Ignition[/b]: All your vehicles will now use actual ignitions instead of just starting up instantly. This also affects low health vehicles, as they'll like to stall more and they'll be harder to start up.\r\n[*][b]Brake disc sounds[/b]: trucks will use air brake sounds too\r\n[*][b]Possibility of vehicles being alarmed[/b]: Some vehicles will spawn with alarms. Lock them and turn them off to arm.\r\n[*][b]Reverse Gear Transmission sound[/b]: Reverse gear now plays a sound, like in GTA:SA but with HD sounds :)\r\n[*][b]More effects for low health vehicles[/b]: Damaged vehicles will huff and puff and backfire more often.\r\n[*][b]Randomized Fuel[/b]: Simfphys cars spawn with random amounts of fuel in their tanks.\r\n[*][b]Fuel Tool[/b]: A tool that can set the current and max fuel amount in a simfphys vehicle.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]What you CAN get with simfphys vehicles that support this addon:[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*][b]Randomized License Plates[/b]: pretty cool maybe\r\n[*][b]Randomized colors on spawn[/b]\r\n[*][b]Randomized bodygroups on spawn[/b]\r\n[*][b]Randomized skins on spawn[/b]\r\n[*][b]Physical trailer legs[/b]: Code is from NotAKid, thank you NAK, very cool\r\n[*][b]Bullhorns[/b] for emergency vehicles\r\n[*][b]Reverse beeping[/b]\r\n[*][b]Custom Ignition sounds[/b] - Also custom shutdown sound that simfphys shoulda really included the option for by default\r\n[*][b]EMS Radio[/b]\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nAlso,\r\n[h1]Most settings can be changed in the simfphys menu, or via ConVars.[/h1]\r\n[b]Convars:[/b]\r\n[i]sv_simfphys_brakenoises\r\nsv_simfphys_license_plates\r\nsv_simfphys_trailer_legs\r\nsv_simfphys_advanced_ignition\r\nsv_simfphys_bullhorn\r\nsv_simfphys_alarms\r\ncl_simfphys_randomcolors\r\ncl_simfphys_randombodygroups\r\ncl_simfphys_vehiclepresets\r\ncl_simfphys_bus_safety_brakes\r\ncl_simfphys_randomfuel\r\ncl_simfphys_randomfuel_min[/i]\r\n[b]All convars have help text in the console.[/b]\r\n\r\n[h1]Supported Addons[/h1]\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1945909088]Left 4 Dead Vehicles[/url]\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3001607373]BMW M3 GTR[/url]\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3347806290]Days Gone Pack[/url]\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3393636742]Volkswagen Polo[/url]\r\nSubmit your addon in the comments if you added support!\r\n\r\n[h1]Incompatible Addons[/h1]\r\nNone known yet, please report addons that are incompatible!\r\n\r\nIn the future this addon might get more features. This way it's easier for me to apply cool changes to ALL my vehicles without having to update every single addon individually.\r\n\r\nIf you want to steal code from this addon to use for yourself or because you can't change something you wanna change, please suggest it to me instead, if it's good enough of a change I will add it to this addon if I can",
