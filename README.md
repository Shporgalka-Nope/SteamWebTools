# SteamWebTools - various steam tools, that are not present in steam client, for average users
Deployed version: [Here](https://shporgalka-nope.github.io/SteamWebTools/)

Current functionality:
- **Collection Weight Viewer**

Currently, Steam has no built-in way to check the total file size (in MB) of a collection of addons. This tool calculates the approximate weight of a given collection.  

**Temporary Access Required** – You first need to grant temporary access to the *CordsAnywhere* service.  
**Why CordsAnywhere?** – Steam's API requires specific headers to process the request, and *CordsAnywhere* provides them.
